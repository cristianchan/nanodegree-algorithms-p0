Task0 : O(1)
Task1 : O(n)
Task2: O(n) calls
Task3: O(nlog(n)) the big efficiency should be the sort function
    we have O(n^2) + O(nlog(n))


Task4: O(nlog(n)) the big efficiency should be the sort function
    we have O(n^3) + O(nlog(n))
    if have a dout here in the if condition the efficiency is O(n^3) or is liner O(n) ?
